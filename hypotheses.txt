Hypotheses:

Camera defines global origin
golbal x = forward
global y = Left
global z = up

camera x = right of frame
camera y = down
camera z = forward

Construction of rail:
Left/Right rails are independant with their own vector of nodes.
Gauge is inforced with additional distance constraints while solving

Consequence:
free 3d rail. no computational singularities (euler/xyztheta..)
